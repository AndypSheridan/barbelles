## **Testing Overview**

At the time of writing this is the largest project I had undertaken so I felt the testing process needed to be as thorough as possible. The project was tested on a variety of devices including a MacBook Pro 2021, a MacBook Air 2020, an iPad Air 2020, iPhone 14 ProMax iPhone 12, iPhone SE, Dell Windows Desktop with 24" Screen, Kindle Fire and a Samsung Galaxy Tablet. The browsers used were Chrome, Safari and Edge.

The majority of User testing was conducted by myself, however I enlisted the help of family and the site owner, essentially to try to break the site or help me identify bugs and areas for improvement.

All buttons and links were clicked multiple times to test they functioned as expected. Multiple test posts, tutorials, comments and profiles were created, edited and deleted to check the efficacy of the CRUD (create, read, update and delete) functionality across the site. 

The social media links open to external pages as intended.

Inevitably there were bugs and these are outlined and summarised below.

Full details of manual testing can be found on this page.

## **Bugs**
‚Äã
The following bugs were identified during user testing:

* Bug üêû - Upon starting the workspace, an error message is displayed relating to the Node version.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - There is a conflict between the template and current version of Node.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - In the terminal, enter: `nvm i 16` > `nvm use 16` > `npm start`.

<br>

* Bug üêû - Received an error in the terminal about a memory leak in the application when updating the profile.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - The error suggested using a clean-up function
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Added a clean-up function to the useEffect hook in EditProfile.js

‚Äã<br>

* Bug üêû - Signing out did not function as expected.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - I traced the error to a missing forward slash in the URL path in the API.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Corrected the typo.

‚Äã<br>

* Bug üêû - The `nmp start` command no longer worked as expected, meaning I lost a full day of project-time.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - The error was on Gitpod's side as a result of an update to the Browser file.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Contacted Gitpod and was assured they were working on a solution. Hoped for a quick fix and fortunately the issue was resolved the following day.

‚Äã<br>

* Bug üêû - The follow button would update the follow count but no longer follow or unfollow as intended
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - Tutor support suggested that the database had somehow become corrupted.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Reset the database, re-connect the database and re-add site content.

<br>

* Bug üêû - Terminal errors when interacting with the app when logged-out. Specifically:
  - 401 errors on mount when not logged in
  - 401 errors when going to the sign/sign up page
  - 401 error when an access token has expired
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - According to the Code Institute walkthrough project, these errors are normal and should be treated as feedback from the API.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Whilst the errors persist, it is reassuring to know these errors can essentially be disregarded for the purpose of this project.

‚Äã<br>

* Bug üêû - Users were able to access edit- and share-post pages when not logged in.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - No defensive design present on these pages.
* Resolution ‚úÖ - Used the useRedirect hook to redirect logged-out users to the sign-in page.

<br>

* Bug üêû - Could not connect to the API.
* Cause ‚öíÔ∏è - Had not removed the trailing slash from the CLIENT_DEV url.
* ‚úÖ - Corrected typo.


<hr>

## **Unfixed Bugs**

* There is a known bug that this app cannot open on Apple mobile devices and most browsers other than Chrome. The bug is that when users try to log in, they will be redirected back to the login page. This bug is due to cookies not being saved in the local storage. For this bug to be fixed on Safari, "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" will need to be turned off in settings. In the case of this app, I was able to use the app as intended on Safari on an iPhone 12, iPhone 14 Pro Max. It would not function as intended using Chrome iOS.

### Scores Summary

The Mobile scores are generally lower in terms of performance with the reason being some issues with the Bootstrap CDN and the images used. The majority of images added during development were already compressed to what I felt was an acceptable limit but images added by users were beyond my control. I had set a limit of 4MB via the back-end project so could perhaps have reduced this without compromising the UX. Some of the lower scores are as a result of the Cloudinary integration and issues with cookies which I feel were beyond my control here.

One major factor resulting in a widespread poor performance score relates to the resolution of the logo. If I had the time, I would revisit this but I found no visible issue with the appearance or performance of the logo itself.

## **Validation**

### ***JavaScript***

I used [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)to test my code for the front-end. The following issues were identified:

![ESLint screenshot](docs/validation/eslint-warnings.png)

* The empty block statements were intentional for this project as students had been asked to delete console.logs from catch blocks. This obviously left the empty blocks. I created a rule in the .eslintrc.json file to ignore these.

* I also created a rule to ignore "do not pass children as props", seeing that this method was related to and prevalent across the Code Institute 'Moments' walkthrough. I did research other methods of achieving the same results, but at the late stage of the project was reluctant to change anything.

* Minor instances relating to newlines, spaces and tabs were fixed and the errors resolved.

* There were also numerous instances of 'no-unused-vars' flagging React being imported but not used. Whilst being aware that recent versions of react do not require this import, I was reluctant to remove them seeing as the ES6 snippet had added the code in the first place. As these were the only unused variables, I turned off the warnings.

With the resolution of these final issues, the linter returned no warnings (the problems in the terminal in the image below all relate to spelling):
